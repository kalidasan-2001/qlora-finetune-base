# QLoRA Fine-Tuning Base

## Description
QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation) is a framework designed for efficient fine-tuning of large language models using low-rank adaptations. This project provides a complete pipeline for training, evaluating, and running inference with QLoRA models.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/qlora-finetune-base.git
   cd qlora-finetune-base
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Configure your environment by modifying the configuration files located in `src/qlora_finetune_base/config/`.

## Example Usage

### Training
To start training a model, use the following command:
```
python src/qlora_finetune_base/cli/train.py --config experiments/configs/qlora_7b.yaml
```

### Evaluation
To evaluate a trained model, run:
```
python src/qlora_finetune_base/cli/evaluate.py --model_path path/to/your/model
```

### Inference
For generating text based on prompts, use:
```
python src/qlora_finetune_base/cli/inference.py --model_path path/to/your/model --prompt "Your prompt here"
```

### Merging LoRA Weights
To merge LoRA weights into the base model, execute:
```
python src/qlora_finetune_base/cli/merge_lora.py --base_model_path path/to/base/model --lora_weights_path path/to/lora/weights
```

## Docker Container
To build and run the Docker container, use the following commands:
```
docker build -t qlora-finetune-base .
docker run -it qlora-finetune-base
```

## Continuous Integration
This project includes a CI pipeline that automatically runs tests on each commit. Ensure that all tests pass before merging any changes. The CI configuration can be found in the `.github/workflows` directory.
