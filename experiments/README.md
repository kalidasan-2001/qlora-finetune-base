# QLoRA Fine-Tuning Experiments

This directory contains documentation and configurations for experiments conducted with the QLoRA fine-tuning project. The experiments aim to evaluate the performance of various model configurations and training strategies.

## Experiment Configurations

- **configs/**: This folder contains YAML configuration files for different model sizes and custom settings.
  - **qlora_7b.yaml**: Configuration settings for the 7 billion parameter model.
  - **qlora_13b.yaml**: Configuration settings for the 13 billion parameter model.
  - **qlora_custom.yaml**: Custom configuration settings tailored for specific experiments.

## Logging

- **logs/**: This folder is intended for storing logs generated during experiments. It is currently empty but will be populated with log files as experiments are conducted.

## Usage

To run experiments, refer to the specific configuration files in the `configs/` directory. Ensure that the necessary dependencies are installed and the environment is set up according to the instructions in the main project README.

## Future Work

Further experiments will be documented here, including results, analysis, and any modifications made to the configurations or training procedures.
